/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Bill Book.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for bill data, ensuring
 * that only the authenticated user can access their own bills and associated items.
 * Seller and client data are publicly readable but not writable through these rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/bills/{billId}: Stores bill information, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/bills/{billId}/items/{itemId}: Stores item details for a specific bill, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /sellers/{sellerId}: Stores seller information, publicly readable.
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client information, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Seller and client data is public and immutable (creation, updates, and deletion are not allowed).
 * - The rules rely on path-based ownership to ensure that users can only access their own data.

     *   `request.resource.name` is the full path of the document. `request.auth.uid` is the ID of the requesting user.
