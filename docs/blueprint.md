## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#75A8D9), offering a sense of reliability and calm that encourages focus. Blue also signals formality for accounting, but this pastel variation suggests the business isn't a huge stuffy corporation.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF2F8), near-white, for a clean professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#A78BFA) for interactive elements and highlights, as purple communicates both creativity and fiscal responsibility.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif for a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Clean, intuitive layout with a clear call-to-action button for creating bills. Prioritize ease of use for quick bill generation.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different bill functions (e.g., add item, share, save).
- Subtle transitions and animations for user interactions to enhance the app's usability.
